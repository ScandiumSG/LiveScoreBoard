# Assumptions

## 1

Selection of which match from the scoreboard was not specified. Assuming this can be done based on the name of the home team.
For larger projects this should probably be some matchID or something, but for this small scale it should be fine.

## 2

Assuming the data is to be processed in some way, therefore no reason to print scores to console.
